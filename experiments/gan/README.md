# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This directory contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network for image generation.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the GAN implementation
- `data/` - Training and validation datasets
- `checkpoints/` - Saved model checkpoints
- `generated_samples/` - Output samples generated by the trained model
- `experiments/` - Experimental configurations and results

## Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two main components:
- Generator: Creates synthetic images from random noise
- Discriminator: Distinguishes between real and generated images

## Training

To train the model:
1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory
2. Run the training script from the `src/` directory
3. Monitor training progress and generated samples

## Results

Generated samples can be found in the `generated_samples/` directory. The model checkpoints are saved in the `checkpoints/` directory for later use or evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Other dependencies as specified in the project's requirements file
